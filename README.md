# Bing_News_Data_Analytics
## Project Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of an end-to-end Azure data engineering solution utilizing Microsoft Fabric, with a particular focus on Bing news data analytics. It encompasses various critical processes, starting with the ingestion of data from the Bing API, followed by the transformation and storage of the data into Delta tables. Advanced sentiment analysis is then performed to derive meaningful insights from the news data. The final stage involves visualizing these insights through a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard.

This initiative underscores the seamless collaboration across disciplines, including data engineering, data science, and data analytics, facilitated by the robust suite of tools offered by Microsoft Fabric. The project showcases technical proficiency in managing and analyzing large-scale data and highlights the potential for interdisciplinary teamwork to drive impactful data-driven decisions while utilizing Microsoft Fabric.
